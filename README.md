# Wave2Vec2 Sprint HuggingFace
Huggingfaces released a model for facebooks fairseqs Wave2Vec2 for low resource speech recognition(sound 2 text). The following was my attempt to finetune and train on the malay language and there are several other [repositories](https://github.com/huseinzol05/malaya-speech) doing this but i thought why not try and fine tune for the sprint.

The langauge i was attempting is in bahasa malaysia (Malay).
The other is a special form of english here in Malaysia (Manglish).
So far the attempted finetuning method is Malay. Will attempt to gather more data on manglish
